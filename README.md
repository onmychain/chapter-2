# chapter-2
ERC20 staking + dapp

## description

Using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin, we will create a basic erc20 token. We will build a basic staking contract that rewards users staking based on the amount of tokens staked. We will connect the staking contract to a dapp where users can stake, withdraw, claim, and compound. they will also be able to see their rewards.
